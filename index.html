                <p class="lead mb-5 pt-3"> Hi! I'm Josh and I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University
                    of Wisconsin Madison in May 2024. I am now pursuing a master's in mental health counseling at Gordon Conwell Theological
                    Seminary. There are three different areas I hope to grow in during my time here:

                            <li><b>Spiritual Formation</b>:  a time for me to be discipled and spend time with God 
                                for my spiritual foundation to be more deeply developed.</li>
                            <li><b>Tools for Mission</b>: a time for me to gather the tools to use the gifts God has given me – 
                                my journey in getting to know God – in order to bless the people around me.</li>
                            <li><b>Healing of Nations</b>: a time for me to get to know different people and discover how God wants 
                                to use me as a vessel towards a restored Eden (Revelation 22).</li>

                        <p>
                        COVID shook up the mission field, especially on college campuses. 
                        For two years, students like myself struggled to pursue community and a 
                        relational discipleship during undergrad. Many campus ministries lost 
                        their foundation, and as I came into UW-Madison in 2021 post-COVID, 
                        the ministries in the area were in a rebuilding period. However, my 
                        experience during COVID was different and life changing. In isolation, 
                        I got into the habit of spending time with God everyday, and everyday 
                        God would grow my heart closer and closer to His. I loved spending time with 
                        Him alone, and He grew my heart to go and serve in my upcoming season at Madison. 
                        So with this heart I went, and boy did I get wrecked. During my time serving, 
                        I realized that all the things God had taught me about loving people and loving
                         Him were SOOO much easier said than done. I am thankful for these experiences 
                         because it helped me realize two other things that showed me the urgency to 
                         become spiritually formed.
                         <ol>
                            <li>
                                Due to the effects of COVID, there is a setback in discipleship and spiritual 
                                development for a lot of folks in this upcoming generation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I am very ill-equipped.
                            </li>
                         </ol>
                        So as I step into seminary, I am praying that God would continue to 
                        develop me further to know His heart better, that I could be a pillar 
                        in this world for God to shine. As the world becomes increasingly 
                        different by the effects of what we are going through, I can’t help 
                        but feel the urgency to know and share God’s heart with the people 
                        around me.

                        <p>
                            Now why counseling? During college I spent some time diving into 
                            the heart of outreach, which led me to scripture with Jesus and the 
                            woman at the well. After her encounter with Jesus, she couldn’t help 
                            but share with the towns how Jesus knew everything about her. As I 
                            reflected on what my encounter with Jesus was like, it was at a 
                            moment where I was brokenhearted and felt unseen. Unknowingly 
                            battling depression at an early age with the loss of my mom, Jesus 
                            revealed to me that I am seen by Him, and deeply loved. And since 
                            then, He has been continuously revealing deeper parts of Himself to
                            me through the avenue of emotional healing. The journey of 
                            believing that I was unlovable to realizing that there is an 
                            almighty being that says otherwise is a gift I dearly cherish, 
                            and want to share with others. I am passionate to help guide people 
                            in their own healing journeys in hopes that they may get to know 
                            the love of Jesus.

                        <p>
                            As I spent time considering whether to pursue a job in computer 
                            science or counseling, God led my heart to take 10 days to 
                            intentionally pray on it (inspired by my devotionals in Jeremiah). 
                            Everyday I went into my time of devotionals expectant and excited 
                            for what God might say, to find no real direction. But it wasn’t 
                            until the 10th day, as I was reading through 
                            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022&version=ESV" target="_blank">Revelations 22,
                            </a> where something really struck my heart. The healing of nations is a piece 
                            that God takes into account when it comes to the kingdom of heaven. 
                            God loves His people dearly, so I can’t imagine how much joy it 
                            brings Him for us to love one another. As I prayed and meditated 
                            that night, my heart for a unified people grew a lot, and I prayed 
                            to be a stepping stone in this unified kingdom. Ever since then, God 
                            has been placing it in my heart to understand the nooks and crannies 
                            of my own Asian American identity, and how that shapes every aspect 
                            of who I am. As I grow to figure myself out, I hope to branch out to 
                            honor other cultures, admire our differences in celebration, become 
                            a stepping stone towards a unified kingdom, and be equipped to guide 
                            fellow Asian Americans towards this bigger kingdom.

                            The Partnership Program is geared to equip future ministers with the 
                            ability to fundraise funds for a ministry, build and maintain 
                            relationships, and an understanding of biblical stewardship. My 
                            participation in the Partnership Program means that I receive a 
                            full-tuition scholarship from GCTS. In order to maintain participation
                            within the program means I have to attain certain goals. These goals
                            include me building and maintaining relationships with monthly 
                            updates, raising about $15,000 yearly, and taking classes
                            to learn and understand biblical stewardship principles.
